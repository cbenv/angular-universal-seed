# Angular Universal Seed

Starter Angular 5 application with server side rendering support on top of angular express engine. Built with `@angular/cli` with [added universal integration](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-universal-rendering). Files are reorganized with minimum changes to have `src/client` and `src/server` structure. Additionally @angular/material and @angular/flex-layout are added and environment removed.
